# get_next_line

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor and also we learned the concept of static variables in C programming.

## Build
You can compile the code as follows for mandatory part(a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
```
and this way for the bonus part:
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files_bonus>.c
```
Or you can compile the code without the BUFFER_SIZE for the mandatory part as follows:
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror <files>.c
```
and this way fot the bonus part:
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror <files_bonus>.c
```
